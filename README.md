# Gofelex - The Go Flexable Enough LEXer

Gofelex is a lexer that is flexible enough for simple lexical analysis. The particularly it works well with recursive descent parsers.

## Current Status

Despite its name, Gofelex is not very fixable at all in its current state. The initial use for the lexer was a school project and it has been hard coded in many places for this purpose. It will be refactored to something more general purpose in the future.
